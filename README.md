<h1> Team Zero Waste: Computer Vision </h1>
<h4>For when you want Vision but aren’t Wanda.</h4>
<p>Welcome to Zero Waste Vision: a chill, 4-week self-paced intro to computer vision. We’ll start from square one (literally, pixels) and show you how images are just numbers in disguise. From reading and tweaking images to playing with webcam feeds and deploying YOLOv8 for object detection, you’ll teach your code to see the world—no chaos magic required.</p>

Wanda rewrote reality with her mind. You? You’ll do it with code. This summer, ditch the drama and embrace the pixels because we’re teaching you how to make machines see using OpenCV, Python, and YOLOv8. It’s 4 weeks of no-pressure, slightly magical computer vision, minus the emotional breakdowns (we hope).


<h3>Here’s the plot twist (a.k.a. what you’ll learn):</h3>

- What is actually an image?
- How computers look at images and say “huh, that’s a cat”
- OpenCV basics: filters, contours, webcam chaos
- YOLOv8 for object detection—because “You Only Look Once” and because “You Only Live Once”
- A final project where you bend reality (or at least a video feed) to your will


We’ll give you curated resources, mini-assignments, and exactly zero lectures. You bring the vibes, Python, and mild curiosity.
Side Effects May Include:
- Saying “bounding box” way too often
- Accidental facial detection in Zoom/gmeet calls
- Feeling slightly too powerful


No prior experience. No heartbreak arcs. Just pure code magic.
Because let’s face it—Wanda walked so your webcam could run. 

<h3>Weekly Time </h3>
6-7 hours/week, depending on how deep you wanna go:
- 2-3 hours watching/reading handpicked tutorials
- 1–2 hours coding + experimentation
- 1-2 hours trying to understand why your webcam looks like a potato ;)

<h3>Evaluative Metrics</h3>
We won't grade you with a red pen, but here's how we’ll know you’re killin’ it:
- Mini Assignments (40%) : Short, hands-on tasks/assignments each week like
- Final Project (50%) : Pick a fun problem → solve it using YOLOv8 ; Example: detect plastic bottles in the trash, find snacks in your room → Submit code + short report (or demo video)
- Meme / Reflection (10%) : One-paragraph takeaway OR one solid meme about your journey. (Extra points for GIFs. We have no shame.)

<h3>Certification Criteria</h3>
To earn your certification:
- Submit all mini assignments (or at least 3/4)
- Complete final project
- Send a meme/reflection that proves you survived
