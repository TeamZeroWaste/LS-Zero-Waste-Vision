# 👁️ Week 1: Seeing the World Through Numbers
## Understanding Computer Vision and the Nature of Images
Welcome to Week 1! This week, we go back to the roots—not of magic or AI hype, but to the fundamentals of how machines interpret the world visually.

The science of enabling machines to **comprehend visual input**, such as pictures and videos, so they can interpret what they "see," is known as ***computer vision***. However, in order to understand this, we must first address two fundamental questions:
## 📷 What is Computer Vision?
Computer vision is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on teaching machines to extract meaningful information from images or videos. This could mean recognizing objects, detecting motion, analyzing facial expressions, or identifying defects in a manufacturing line.  

The goal is **not just to store or display images**, but to interpret them—turning raw pixels into actionable data.

Think of it like this:
* Humans look at an image and instantly understand its context.
* Machines see a **matrix of pixel values**—and that’s it.

Computer vision is the bridge between those two ways of seeing.
## 🧮 What is an Image (to a Machine)?
An image, for a computer, is a grid (or matrix) of pixels. Each pixel represents a color value. In a color image:
* Each pixel has 3 values (called as **channels**): Red, Green, Blue (RGB).
* These values range from 0 to 255.

So, for a 100x100 image:
* There are 10,000 pixels.
* Each pixel has 3 color channels.
*That’s 30,000 numbers.

**Grayscale images?** Just one number per pixel. Black is 0, white is 255, and everything in between is a shade of gray.

The image you're viewing right now on your screen is really just numbers stored in a file format like .png or .jpg, decoded and rendered to look like what your brain would expect.  
For a machine, there’s no racoon. Just [34, 76, 123], repeated thousands or millions of times.
## 🔍 This Week’s Focus
Our objective this week is simple: **understand how images work at the pixel level**, and learn how to manipulate them using code.
